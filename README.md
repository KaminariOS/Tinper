# Tinper: A Dating App Simulator with Real Profiles

Tinper is a dating app simulator that mimics the experience of popular dating platforms. Swipe right on profiles you like, initiate conversations, and see where it goes! This simulator is designed for entertainment and educational purposes, allowing users to experience dating app mechanics without real-world consequences. Currently it only have profiles of women because of data availability.

## Features

- **Tinder-like Swiping Interface**: Experience the familiar swiping motion to like or pass on profiles
- **Detailed Profile Cards**: View comprehensive information about each profile including photos, personal details, and prompts
- **Matching System**: Build your collection of matches by swiping right on profiles you're interested in
<!-- - **AI-Powered Chat**: Engage in conversations with your matches through intelligent chat responses -->
- **Profile Viewing**: Examine detailed information about your matches in a dedicated profile view
- **Advanced Filtering**: Customize your experience with filters for nationality, ethnicity, and age range
- **Statistics Tracking**: Monitor your swiping habits with detailed statistics on likes and passes
- **Persistent Data Storage**: All your swipes and conversations are saved locally using IndexedDB
- **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive interface that works well on mobile devices

## Note
Even though dating apps get notorious for bad user experience these days, I always find the swiping UI/UX quite innovative and addictive.

Crafting a Tinder clone from scratch would cost me too much time, but the advent of AI coding agents like Cursor.ai, Windsurf and Blackbox greatly speed up the development process.

I have heard about AI coding agents a lot but this is my first time trying to build something with it.

The result is way beyond my expection: AI can write 90% of the code with minimal effort. However, the rest 10% of debugging and tweaking will take up 90% of your time. 


## Disclaimers

- This is a simulator/parody application for entertainment purposes only
- Profile prompts are fictional and compiled from publicly available data sources
<!-- - Chat responses are generated by artificial intelligence -->
- This is not a real dating service and no actual connections will be made
- Profile data is collected from open internet sources
- Profiles will be removed if the photo owner submits an issue

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
